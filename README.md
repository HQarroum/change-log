## What's a release note ?

Release notes are documents that are distributed with software products, sometimes when the product is still in the development or test state (e.g., a beta release). For products that have already been in use by clients, the release note is delivered to the customer when an update is released. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_notes)

## Why a project for that ?

I've created this project for my own personal use in the first place. I actually use this format for communicating with thrid-party developers or clients about the changes involved in each version of the software I deliver. The main reasons I use this release note format is :

 * I find it to be very user-friendly, and radically changes the perception of the *ugly-and-hard-to-read* release note found in the middle of a project.
 
* I like to separate components associated with the delivery with the actual project and its source when it is possible.

* Using an HTML rich document makes it also possible to embed a lot more semantic elements (both syntaxically and graphically) in the document to give more sense out of each release.

This format is not suited for every use-case though, especially when an existing solution is available on the project/platform you are woking on/with. For instance using this format with open-source projects on Github may seem overkill since a single `CHANGELOG.md` might suffice.
