If you are using GDB to debug PNaCl <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/devguide/devcycle/debugging.html#debugging-pnacl-pexes">BC files with debug metadata in the browser</a>, remember that debug info from SDK version X is only compatible with the PNaCl translator in chrome version X.<br>The bitcode debug metadata format changed from LLVM 3.5 to 3.6. If you need to debug an app built with SDK version X running in Chrome version Y (with X != Y), it is still possible to do so.<br></li><li>PNaCl’s support for use of libstdc++ 4.6 as the C++ standard library is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. PNaCl has used libc++ (which is much more up-to-date, currently based on LLVM 3.6) as the default since Pepper 33.</li></ul></li><li><h3>Pepper</h3><ul><li>UDP Socket Multicast API in development preview (PPB_UDP_SOCKET 1.2).</li><li>Hardware Video Encoder API in development preview (PPB_VIDEO_ENCODER 0.1).</li></ul></li></ul></div></article><article id="42" class="release"><div class="page-header"><h2>Release Note <small>Chrome/Pepper</small> <span class="label label-success">Version 42</span> <span class="label label-warning">20 February 2015</span></h2></div><div class="release-body"><p class="page-description">Below is a list that enumerates the functionality introduced by this version of the Chrome browser :</p><ul><li><h3>SDK</h3><ul><li>The SDK now contains experimental versions of i686-nacl-clang, x86_64-nacl-clang, and arm-nacl-clang as well as the clang++ equivalents.<br>These toolchains are based on the same LLVM version as PNaCl, but can be used to generate NaCl .nexe files instead of translating a .pexe locally or using the GCC toolchain.</li></ul></li><li><h3>NaCl</h3><ul><li>The x86 NaCl validators accept instructions from the FMA3 extensions, as well as AVX2 instructions (except VGATHER).</li></ul></li><li><h3>PNaCl</h3><ul><li>PNaCl supports C11/C++11 memory orders acquire, release, and acq_rel. It used to upgrade all accesses to seq_cst.<br>It still upgrades consume to acquire (no compiler currently implements consume), and relaxed to seq_cst (to conservatively avoid platform differences due to out-of-thin-air problems).<br><br><div class="alert alert-block" style="max-width : 500px"><h4>Note</h4><div>This is currently disabled by default in the SDK so that the in-browser translator installed on users’ machines has time to gain this support.
